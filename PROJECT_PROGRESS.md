**Completion Date:** 2025-01-12

**Planned:**
- Create root directory structure
- Create README.md
- Create .gitignore
- Initialize Git repository
- Create initial commit

**Implementation:**
- [x] Directory structure created
  - [x] `backend/` directory
  - [x] `ml_engine/` directory
  - [x] `frontend/` directory
  - [x] `docker/` directory
  - [x] `docs/` directory
  - [x] `scripts/` directory
  - [x] `tests/` directory
- [x] README.md created with project overview, features, structure, and quick start
- [x] .gitignore created with comprehensive Python, Node, Docker, and project-specific ignores
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] Initial commit created (commit: ce61ca0)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Created: `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide
- Created: `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns
- Created: `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` - Master progress tracker
- Created: Directory structure (backend/, ml_engine/, frontend/, docker/, docs/, scripts/, tests/)
- Modified: Git repository initialized

**Decisions Made:**
1. **Directory Structure:** Followed the planned structure from Master Checklist exactly
2. **README.md:** Included essential information: overview, features, tech stack, structure, quick start
3. **.gitignore:** Comprehensive patterns covering Python, Node.js, Docker, IDEs, ML models, and project-specific files
4. **Git Initialization:** Initialized as master branch (standard Git default)

**Issues Faced:**
- None - All tasks completed successfully

**Summary:**
Sub-Phase 1.1 completed successfully. All required directories created, README.md and .gitignore files created with appropriate content, Git repository initialized, and initial commit made. Project structure is now ready for next sub-phase.
